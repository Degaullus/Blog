        <p>Lillehammer is a small and beautifull looking city in Norway (28 000 habitants) newed for his innovative and really young start up Aviant's.
        </p>
        <p>During the pandemic, they created this inovative delivery business to shipp medical material, COVID tests and Blood. They growed of course fast and significally.</p>
        <p>Now ready to deliver more and faster in a area from 30km under 5 minutes they said. The new machine is about 2.5 metter long and can fly over 100km/h couplpe with a payload of 1,5 kg. Looks beautifull by the way. Like a modern replica of an old fashioned <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=dcfe5edb8f188ebf&sxsrf=ACQVn09P5uAvv-gNm38QhG-aEda501KHug:1708588098063&q=lockheed+p38&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjK5pvVur6EAxW5zgIHHRrgDtcQ0pQJegQICRAB&biw=1186&bih=976&dpr=1">P-38</a>. </p>
        <p>“We are living in a world where people want things fast, at a competitive price, and using sustainable methods,” Lars Erik Fagernæs, Aviant’s co-founder and CEO. Yes sure, this remember me the  start of the actual giant Uber Eat. Just make it faster in the silicopn valley food delivery traffic. Because yes. What's is about now? Who are the customer? What are your ordering every week?  </p>
        <p>I use amazon (shame on me) to get 3D printing material weekly to feed my business. What's about other peeps? Food could be there delivered by robots everywhere. Crazy. </p>

        <h1>Micropayement and Websites</h1>
        <ul class="tag"><a href="">techNews</a>, <a href="">2024.02.14</a></ul>
        <p>Until now, there are basically two famous ways to make money with your website: sell some space for ads (and get money from them) or create your paywall and manage subscriptions.</p>
<p>According to <a target=blank href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/google_micropayments_plan/">The Register</a>, Chrome engine developers are working on micropayment prototypes. In a few words, any request will generate a small amount of cash (very small, like cents). The principle is easy: Small amounts and no active user interaction for it. Just surfing.</p>
<p>How could it work? Simply by endowing users and creators with a digital wallet and using an open Payment API. Hehe, we know this one right ? Every click/request enables a small microtransaction. Your .get and ${} are really starting to make sense.</p>
<p>The concept is not new; some serious discussions already started in the '90s: In the past, some voices raised and shouted that micropayment will be the future. But, you know, skepticism won.  Today, the development of crypto, blockchaining, and decentralized wallets seems to give a new start to this thing.</p>
<p>Can't wait to earn 0.10 cent a day.</p>

        <h1>Is your Laundry machine internet addict?</h1>
        <ul class="tag"><a href="">techNews</a>, <a href="">2024.01.10</a> 
        <p>Johnny works in tech domains and loves to take a deeper look at everything connected, like his LG washing machine. While exploring his Asus router interface, he discovered that his washing machine uploaded 3.57GB of data every day. Fun.

        <p>Johnny posted a <a target=blank href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/195dtqm/user_of_lg_washing_machine_spotted_that_it_spent/">screenshot</a> and let the community analyze this fact,  here are some of the best theories. Is the washing machine being used as a crypto mining tool? Or is the laundry uploading data to LG to improve the upcoming LLM (Large Laundry Model)? Or is the machine using Johnny's WIFI for DLCs (Downloadable Laundry Circle) (note: DLCs are normally associated with video game Downloadable Content)?</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, the owner did not got deeper into it, and we don't know what happened after. The most viable explanation could be an issue with his Asus router tool?</p>
            
            <p>Amidst the fun, remember that every smart home device has access to the internet, which means potential vulnerabilities and the potential to be hacked. So behind this fun, some hard facts remain.</p>

        <h1>An old One, but a good One. GTA, adolescence and hacking</h1>
        <a href="">February, 8th 2024</a>
        <p>Back in 2021 and 2022, the hacker Arion Kurtaj and his cybercrime group, Lapsus$, shocked the cybersecurity world. They were already known for attacks on Uber and other major digital platforms. In 2022, they stole informations from Nvidia and demanded a ransom of $4 million. Additionally, they requested the cessation of special R&D projects that slowed down cryptomining. They get arrested in March 2022 after Kurtaj's colleague doxxed him, exposing personal information about him online, includinga nice fishing pictures.
            <br>
            <br>
            But the story didn't end there. Under police protection, Kurtaj managed to hack into Rockstar again in December 2023. He stole 90 clips of the new GTA 6 and threatened to release the source code. Despite being banned from internet usage and forbidden to access a computer, he accomplished everything from a hotel room using an Amazon stick UNDER police protection. 
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The funny and notable part is that Arion Kurtaj is only 18 years old, and his buddy is 17. Kurtaj's expressed intention to return to cybercrime after his initial conviction worked against him. Due to his autism diagnosis, he was sentenced to an indefinite youth rehabilitation order.

        <p>Ok let's go. It has to start somewhere. It's 6:30, I'm studying at WBS Coding school since 5 weeks and I feel strange. Like every start of the week (we are tuesday), I have the impression that I'am really dumb. But you know what? soon will be friday, and friday I always discover that I'm not dumb at all and that I understood and learnt so much ! From zero to hero, that's the way you go every fucking week in a coding bootcamp. So grab your 5th coffee, put your glasses on your nose, and come with me. It's all about (trying) to understand coding baby!</p>

        <h2>Deep fake level 3 and 25 millions stolen</h2>
        <p>Ok it happended : Deep faking is no longer stucked limited to Lovescam.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, a meeting took place involving employees, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and a clerk. However, it was later discovered that only the clerk was a human participant; all other attendees were AI-generated. The fraudulent meeting utilized past video footage to create the illusion of a real conference. During the meeting, the human clerk was instructed to carry out transactions totaling $25 million. Subsequently, six individuals (this time real), who were the real orchestrators of the fraudulent scheme, were already arrested.</p>

        <h2>Some notions about API</h2>
        <p>We just started with API. before we get lost, let's talk about certain notions bro.</p>
        <p>THE ENDPOINT is the moment where you can write an interaction with an API. Like sumoning it in dungeons and dragons. Love it. You have some option for this : "get", "put", "post" and "delete"(request method). This is the end of the URL, full of power,
        </p>
        <p>Basicelly, they are powerfull sumoning tools. Some of them less. For example, with the request "get", you will be able to get the information (like the users, mails, ect). But with some other, who sounds more like dark magic spells, you can create inside the website (like with the request "post"). The </p>
        <p>So biggest questions : What is an API (comuunication bet
            etwen client app and server app), what is an Endpoint () ? What is a request ?</p>
        <p>Client: This is the application or system that initiates the request. It could be a web browser, a mobile app, a server, or any other software component that needs to interact with the API.

            Server: This is the system hosting the API. It receives requests from clients, processes them, and sends back responses containing the requested data or performing the requested actions.
            
            HTTP Protocol: API requests are typically made over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure version, HTTPS. HTTP defines a set of methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource located on the server.
            
            Endpoint: An endpoint is a specific URL that represents a resource on the server. API requests are sent to specific endpoints to perform actions or retrieve data related to that resource. For example, /users might be an endpoint to retrieve a list of users, and /products/123 might be an endpoint to retrieve information about a specific product with ID 123.
            
            Request Method: The request method specifies the type of action the client wants to perform on the resource. The most common methods are:
            
            GET: Retrieve data from the server.
            POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
            PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
            DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
            Request Headers: Headers contain additional information about the request, such as authentication credentials, content type, or cache control directives.
            
            Request Body: For some request methods, such as POST and PUT, the client may need to send additional data in the request body. This data could be in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or form data, depending on the API's requirements.
            
            Response: After receiving and processing the request, the server sends back a response to the client. The response typically includes a status code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error) and, optionally, a response body containing the requested data or an error message.</p>
