        <p>Ok let's go. It has to start something. It's 6:30, I'm studying at WBS Coding school since 5 weeks and I feel strange. Like every start of the week (we are tuesday), I have the impression that I'am really dumb. But you know what? soon will be friday, and friday I always discover that I'm not dumb at all and that I understood and learnt so much ! From zero to hero, that's the way you go every fucking week in a coding bootcamp. So grab your 5th coffee, put your glasses on your nose, and come with me. It's all about (trying) to understand coding baby!</p>

        <p>Ok it happended : Deep faking is no longer stucked limited to Lovescam.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, a meeting took place involving employees, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and a clerk. However, it was later discovered that only the clerk was a human participant; all other attendees were AI-generated. The fraudulent meeting utilized past video footage to create the illusion of a real conference. During the meeting, the human clerk was instructed to carry out transactions totaling $25 million. Subsequently, six individuals (this time real), who were the real orchestrators of the fraudulent scheme, were already arrested.</p>
